# ðŸš€ Automated Application Deployment to VM using GitHub Actions (with Rollback Support)

## ðŸ“Œ Concept Overview

This project automates the deployment of a web application to a virtual machine (VM) using **GitHub Actions**. The solution:

- Delivers seamless application updates from code commits to the live environment.
- Minimizes manual intervention and deployment errors.
- Implements a **rollback mechanism** to revert to the last stable state in case of failure.
- Ensures high availability and faster recovery, especially for production environments.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To implement a **robust and reliable CI/CD pipeline** using:
- **GitHub Actions** for automation,
- **Rsync** for efficient file transfers,
- **Systemd-managed services** like **Gunicorn** and **Celery**,
- **Rollback support** in case of deployment issues,
- Log management with **logrotate**,
- Conditional service restarts based on code changes.
